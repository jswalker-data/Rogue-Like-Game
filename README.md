# 🧙 Rogue-like Game (WIP)

This is a simple rogue-like game built in Python using the [tcod](https://python-tcod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library, inspired by classic dungeon crawlers.

## 🕹️ Features (so far)

- Basic movement and input handling
- Procedural dungeon generation
- Player character and simple entities
- Simple spawning and pathing AI
- Initial simple combat system
- Turn and action history

## 🚧 Status

This project is **a work in progress** and is being built in my spare time. The goal is to learn more about game architecture, rendering, and turn-based mechanics using Python and low-level libraries like `tcod`.

---

## 🧪 Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `tcod` (install with `pip install tcod`)
- Runs in a terminal or console window

---

## 📸 Screenshots

Coming soon — screenshots of each development stage will be added here later.

---

## 🚀 Run the Game

To start the game:

```bash
python main.py
